        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ever since I was first introduced to Josef Müller-Brockmann and his work in the early weeks of my time as an IXD student, I have been heavily impressed by the way he approached his work as it was unlike anything any other designer was capable of doing at the time. Müller-Brockmann was, and still is, one of the most influential figures in graphic design and has changed my approach to design, opening my mind to new approaches I would have never considered before. In my essay today I will be discussing some of his most important fundamentals and methods, how they influenced design at the time and how they are still influencing my work today.</p>

        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p> Born in 1914 in Rapperswil, Switzerland, Müller-Brockmann attended the prestigious University of Zurich and the city’s Kunstgewerbeschule in his first steps to becoming a professional designer, studying architect, art, and design. He would go on to open his own Zurich studio in 1936 which he would specialize in photography, graphics and exhibition design and he established his position as the country’s leading practioner and theorist of swiss style. Müller-Brockmann became known for his poster work that he began to do in the 1950’s in particular the ‘Musica Viva’ poster for the Tonhalle music concert. The simplicity of these posters is what impressed me the most and has influenced my work today as it has allowed me to become comfortable with having simple shapes and colours in my designs as they are effective.</p>

        
            
        <p>In the late 1950’s is the time marked as when he began his career as an art instructor, being appointed as a Professor of Graphic Design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich, where he would influence the next generation of designers. Besides teaching and serving as design consultant, Müller-Brockmann also authored several books on graphic designing including his infamous ‘Grid systems in Graphic Design’ which has heavily influenced my work today, changing the way I think about the structure and layout of my content. Müller-Brockmann died in Zurich on 30th August 1996 after living a life where he contributed to many different projects that helped shape graphic design today.</p>
